# 🥔 Batata

**Batata** is a tiny text editor written from scratch in **C** — built as a fun side project to dive into low-level file handling, terminal control, and how editors actually work under the hood. Inspired by [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo), but with my own flavor.

---

## ✨ Features

- Basic text editing (type, delete, move around)
- Open/save any files
- Raw terminal input handling (arrow keys, Ctrl combos)
- Simple status bar + screen refresh logic

That's it — no tabs, no mouse support, no fluff. Just a potato-simple editor.

## ⚙️ How to Build & Run

```bash
git@github.com:Dragonslayer-9095/batata.git
cd batata
make
./batata [filename]
```
HUGE WIP
