# ü•î Batata Editor

A lightweight, Vi-inspired terminal text editor written in C (~3300 lines). Batata combines the power of modal editing with modern features like syntax highlighting, mouse support, and intuitive key bindings.

## Features

### Core Editing
- **Modal editing** - Normal, Insert, Visual, and Replace modes
- **Vi-like key bindings** - Familiar navigation and editing commands
- **Undo/Redo system** - Full edit history with `u` and `Ctrl+R`
- **Cut, Copy, Paste** - Text manipulation with clipboard support
- **Find functionality** - Search through files with `/`

### Advanced Navigation
- **Motion commands** - `h/j/k/l`, `w/b/e`, `f/t/F/T` for precise cursor movement
- **Numeric prefixes** - Repeat commands with number prefixes (e.g., `5j`)
- **Line jumping** - `gg`, `G`, `H/M/L` for quick navigation
- **Bracket matching** - `%` to jump between matching brackets
- **Scrolling** - Page up/down, half-page scrolling with `Ctrl+U/D`

### Visual Enhancements
- **Syntax highlighting** - Color-coded syntax for better readability
- **Line numbers** - Absolute or relative line numbering
- **Mouse support** - Click to position cursor, scroll with mouse wheel
- **Visual selection** - Select text blocks in visual mode
- **Status messages** - Informative status bar with tips and warnings

### Editor Modes
- **Normal mode** (`n`) - Navigation and commands
- **Insert mode** (`i`) - Text insertion
- **Visual mode** (`v`) - Text selection
- **Replace mode** (`r`) - Character replacement
- **Dumb mode** (`-d`) - Simplified mode for basic terminals

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- POSIX-compliant terminal
- Linux/Unix environment

<details>
<summary><b>üì¶ Ubuntu/Debian (via PPA) - Recommended</b></summary>

```bash
# Add the PPA repository
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rational-idiot/ppa

# Update package list and install
sudo apt update && sudo apt install batata
```

This is the easiest method for Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Note for v1.0.0:
The current Ubuntu release (v1.0.0) has a bug where it looks for the configuration file .batatarc in the source directory where batata.c is located, not in the standard configuration directory. This means configuration is not available for PPA installations.
Workaround for v1.0.0 PPA users:
Unfortunately, there's no practical way to create a configuration file for the PPA installation due to this bug. You'll need to wait for a future release or build from source if you need configuration options.

### Configuration
Batata looks for configuration in `~/.config/batata/.batatarc`. Create this directory and file to customize your editor settings.
The default config is
```
TAB_LENGTH=2                     // Set how many spaces a TAB insertion is rendered as
RELATIVE_LINE_NUMBERS=1          // Set to 0 to use absolute line numbers
UNDO_STACK_SIZE=100              // Sets how much memory the Undo Stack consumes
AUTO_COMPLETION=1                // COmpletes (,{,<,",'
DUMB =0;                         // Only allow insert mode
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start with a new file
batata

# Open an existing file
batata filename.txt

# Start in dumb mode (insert-only)
batata -d filename.txt
```

### Advanced Features

#### Numeric Prefixes
Most commands can be prefixed with numbers:
```
5j    # Move down 5 lines
d3w   # Delete 3 words
y2k   # Yank 3 lines (the current one and the 2 above it {pro tip: Use relative line numebers})
```

#### Mouse Support
- **Left click** - Position cursor
- **Right click** - Context menu (future feature)
- **Scroll wheel** - Scroll up/down

#### Bracket Matching
Press `%` on any bracket `()`, `{}`, `[]`, or `<>` to jump to its matching pair. The editor intelligently handles nested brackets and ignores brackets within strings and comments.

#### Inside braces and quotes
Press `di(` to delete the text inside the `()` it deletes inside the parantheses if the cursor is inside one or searches for the next set of `()` on the current line
similarly the `i` motion can be combined with y and c to alter text inside `(), <>, [], {}, '', ""`

### Syntax Highlighting
Automatic syntax highlighting is enabled by default. The editor detects file types and applies appropriate color schemes.

## Architecture

- **Row Management** - Text buffer handling with dynamic arrays
- **Input Processing** - Modal command processing
